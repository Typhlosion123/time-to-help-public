Tired of setting screen time goals you never stick to?
Time 2 Help turns your commitment into accountability by letting you put money on the line. If you miss your goal, your bounty is automatically donated to charity — so you win either way.

💡 How It Works
Set your goal – Decide how much time you want to spend on specific sites or apps each day.
Add a bounty – Deposit an amount that motivates you to stay disciplined.
Earn your refund – Hit your daily goal and keep your bounty. Go over — and it’s donated to charity automatically.
